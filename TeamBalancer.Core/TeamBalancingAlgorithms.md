# Team Balancing Algorithm Approaches

This document outlines available approaches for implementing team balancing algorithms in the TeamBalancer application.

## Data Model Context

Players have three skill attributes (1-3 scale):
- Speed
- TechnicalSkills
- Stamina
- OverallSkillLevel (calculated as average of the three attributes)

Teams track:
- Player count
- Average for each skill attribute
- Overall team skill
- Total skill points

## Available Approaches

### 1. Greedy/Snake Draft Algorithm

**How it works**: Sort players by skill level in descending order, then alternate picking players between teams (Team A, Team B, Team B, Team A, Team A, Team B, etc.).

**Pros**:
- Fast O(n log n) time complexity
- Simple to implement and understand
- Intuitive for users familiar with sports drafts

**Cons**:
- Not guaranteed optimal
- Can miss better combinations
- Doesn't look ahead

**Best for**: Quick balancing, real-time drafts, small to medium player pools

**Implementation complexity**: Low

### 2. Bin Packing/First-Fit Approach

**How it works**: Sort players by skill level descending, then assign each player to the team with the lowest current total skill level.

**Pros**:
- Fast O(n log n) time complexity
- Usually produces good results
- Simple logic

**Cons**:
- Greedy approach can create local optimums
- No backtracking if better solutions exist

**Best for**: Large player pools where speed is priority, initial quick balance

**Implementation complexity**: Low

---

### 3. Iterative Swapping/Hill Climbing

**How it works**: Start with an initial assignment (random or from another algorithm), then repeatedly swap players between teams if the swap reduces the skill difference between teams.

**Pros**:
- Better balance than pure greedy approaches
- Can refine results from other algorithms
- Configurable stopping criteria (iterations, time, threshold)

**Cons**:
- Can get stuck in local optimums
- Performance depends on initial state
- May require many iterations

**Best for**: Medium-sized pools (10-30 players), refining other algorithm results

**Implementation complexity**: Medium

---

### 4. Genetic Algorithm

**How it works**: Create multiple random team configurations (population), evaluate fitness (balance quality), select best solutions, crossover and mutate to create new generations, evolve toward optimal solution.

**Pros**:
- Can find near-optimal solutions
- Handles multiple objectives simultaneously
- Avoids local optimums better than hill climbing
- Can balance multiple constraints (skill balance, player count, etc.)

**Cons**:
- Slower than greedy approaches
- More complex implementation
- Requires tuning (population size, mutation rate, etc.)
- Non-deterministic results

**Best for**: Complex constraints, offline optimization, when quality matters more than speed

**Implementation complexity**: High

---

### 5. Constraint Programming/Integer Linear Programming

**How it works**: Formulate team balancing as a mathematical optimization problem with objective function (minimize skill variance) and constraints (equal team sizes, etc.). Use solver library to find optimal solution.

**Pros**:
- Can find truly optimal solution
- Handles complex constraints naturally
- Proven mathematical approach

**Cons**:
- Can be slow for large player pools
- Requires external solver library (e.g., Google OR-Tools, CPLEX)
- More complex to set up
- May not scale well

**Best for**: Perfect balance needed, multiple complex constraints, smaller player pools (< 30)

**Implementation complexity**: High (requires external dependencies)

---

### 6. Multi-Objective Optimization

**How it works**: Instead of balancing only OverallSkillLevel, balance all three skill attributes (Speed, Technical Skills, Stamina) simultaneously. Can use weighted scoring or Pareto optimization.

**Approaches**:
- **Weighted Sum**: Minimize variance across all attributes with configurable weights
- **Pareto Optimization**: Find solutions where no attribute can be improved without worsening another
- **Min-Max**: Minimize the maximum difference in any attribute

**Pros**:
- Creates balanced teams across all dimensions
- More realistic for sports (different attributes matter)
- Prevents teams from being strong in one area but weak in others

**Cons**:
- More complex scoring function
- May not always find perfect balance across all attributes
- Harder to explain to users

**Best for**: When individual attributes matter (not just overall), creating well-rounded teams

**Implementation complexity**: Medium to High (depending on approach)

## Recommendations

### Option A: Start Simple (Recommended for MVP)
1. Implement **Snake Draft** or **Bin Packing** algorithm
2. Balance based on `OverallSkillLevel`
3. Add UI to display team statistics
4. Allow manual adjustments after balancing

**Estimated effort**: 2-4 hours

---

### Option B: Better Quality (Recommended for Production)
1. Implement **Iterative Swapping** with multi-objective scoring
2. Balance all 3 attributes simultaneously
3. Target: minimize variance across Speed, Technical Skills, and Stamina between teams
4. Use weighted scoring to prioritize attributes if needed
5. Allow configurable number of iterations

**Estimated effort**: 4-8 hours

---

### Option C: Best Results (Advanced)
1. Implement **Genetic Algorithm** with weighted fitness function
2. Consider all attributes + player count equality
3. Generate multiple solution candidates
4. Let user pick from top solutions or auto-select best
5. Add configuration for algorithm parameters (population size, generations, etc.)

**Estimated effort**: 8-16 hours

---

## Hybrid Approach (Recommended)

Combine multiple algorithms for best results:

1. **Initial Assignment**: Use Bin Packing for fast initial distribution
2. **Refinement**: Apply Iterative Swapping to improve balance
3. **Multi-Objective**: Balance across all three skill attributes
4. **User Control**: Allow manual swaps with live balance updates

This approach provides:
- Fast initial results
- High-quality final balance
- User control and transparency
- Reasonable implementation complexity

**Estimated effort**: 6-10 hours

## Implementation Structure

Suggested class structure:

```csharp
namespace TeamBalancer.Core.Services.Balancing
{
    public interface ITeamBalancingStrategy
    {
        List<Team> BalanceTeams(List<Player> players, int numberOfTeams);
        double CalculateBalanceScore(List<Team> teams);
    }

    public class SnakeDraftStrategy : ITeamBalancingStrategy { }
    public class BinPackingStrategy : ITeamBalancingStrategy { }
    public class IterativeSwapStrategy : ITeamBalancingStrategy { }
    public class GeneticAlgorithmStrategy : ITeamBalancingStrategy { }

    public class TeamBalancingService
    {
        public List<Team> BalanceTeams(
            List<Player> players,
            int numberOfTeams,
            ITeamBalancingStrategy strategy);
    }
}
```
